The program was relatively easy to develop, but it was not without its fair share of troubles. We started segmenting the project into portions both of us could take care of. I tackled the main menu screens, while Jesse handled the screens with the quiz questions.
      In the midst of completing our portions, we realized it would be difficult to tie the two screens together. With the help of Mr. Landfried, we decided to just use the screens with the quiz questions, and have a window pop up on launch, asking the user if they wished to continue. This method made the process much more fluid, and now our last few tasks were to create more questions, get the menus to work, and create an end to the quiz game., so finding where each segment fit in the code was difficult.
       Once we had everything working, we did a test-run, and found that we were almost successful. One major issue was when the quiz game would skip certain questions. This was solved by fixing broken values and some fine-tuning. We were able to efficiently complete the quiz game on time, and in working function.
