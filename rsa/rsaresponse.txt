The program was relatively easy to develop, but it was not without its fair share of troubles. We started by dividing each part of the program into different segments (the encryption function, the decryption function, the option to select to encrypt or decrypt, etc.). Building off this, we each tackled different segments and finished each within a matter of days.
        After each portion was completed, all we had to do was piece each segment together as if it were a puzzle. This proved to be troubling, as the entire program had to run on a While Loop, so finding where each segment fit in the code was difficult. We decided to fit each section into a For Loop,  following each segment with Else-If Statements. This served as the frame of the program, with the While Loop essentially running the entire program.
        Once we had everything working, we did a test-run, and found that we were almost successful. One major issue, as well as our final issue, was that our Look-Up Table was not functioning correctly, and would interfere with the decryption function. This was solved by renaming different values around and some fine-tuning. We were able to efficiently complete our program on-time, and it works perfectly today.
